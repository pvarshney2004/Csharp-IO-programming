  Sort employee records by salary in descending order and display the top five highest-paid employees.

---

### 🔹 Advanced Level

- **Validate CSV Data Before Processing**  
  Validate email format using regex and ensure phone numbers contain exactly 10 digits.  
  Print invalid rows with appropriate error messages.

- **Convert CSV Data into Objects**  
  Read CSV data and convert each row into a `Student` object, storing all objects in a list.

- **Merge Two CSV Files**  
  Merge two CSV files based on a common ID field and generate a new CSV with combined data.

- **Detect Duplicate Records**  
  Identify and print duplicate records in a CSV file based on the ID column.

- **Convert CSV ↔ JSON**  
  Convert student data from JSON format to CSV and implement reverse conversion from CSV to JSON.

---

---

### 🔹 `streams-problems` branch
This branch focuses on **Stream-based I/O operations in C#**, covering low-level and high-level stream handling techniques.  
The problems emphasize **efficient file processing, serialization, memory streams, buffering, and binary data handling**, which are essential for building scalable and performance-aware applications.

---

## 📝 Practice Problems

### 🔹 File & Basic Stream Operations

- **File Handling – Read and Write a Text File**  
  Read the contents of a text file and write them into a new file.  
  Handle missing source files and ensure destination file creation using `FileStream`.

- **Read User Input from Console and Save to File**  
  Accept user details (name, age, favorite programming language) from the console and store them in a file using stream readers and writers.

---

### 🔹 Buffered & Performance-Oriented Streams

- **Buffered Streams – Efficient File Copy**  
  Copy a large file using `BufferedStream` and compare its performance with unbuffered file streams using a stopwatch.

- **Filter Streams – Uppercase to Lowercase Conversion**  
  Read text from a file and write it to another file while converting all uppercase characters to lowercase efficiently.

---

### 🔹 Memory & Byte Streams

- **ByteArray Stream – Convert Image to Byte Array**  
  Convert an image file into a byte array using `MemoryStream` and recreate the image from the byte array.

---

### 🔹 Serialization & Binary Streams

- **Serialization – Save and Retrieve Objects**  
  Serialize and deserialize a list of employee objects using binary or JSON serialization techniques.

- **Data Streams – Store and Retrieve Primitive Data**  
  Store student details (roll number, name, GPA) in a binary file using `BinaryWriter` and retrieve them using `BinaryReader`.

---

### 🔹 Stream-Based Data Processing

- **Count Words in a File**  
  Read a text file, count word occurrences using a dictionary, and display the top five most frequently occurring words.

---
